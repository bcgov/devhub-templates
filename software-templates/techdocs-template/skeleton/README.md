## About

This is a default [README.md](README.md) file generated by the template. Customize it for your project.


## Adding documentation

The homepage of your documentation is in the [docs/index.md](docs/index.md) file. Edit it to suit your usage. Warning: do not delete this file. 

Add documentation pages by  adding more markdown (.md) files to the [docs](docs) folder.

## Table of Contents

The Table of Contents on the right is generated based on the hierarchy
of headings. Only use one H1 (`#` in Markdown) per file.

## Site navigation

For new pages to appear in the left hand navigation you need to edit the [mkdocs.yml](mkdocs.yml) file
to include a `nav` section.  The navigation can also link out to other sites.

If there is no `nav` section in [mkdocs.yml](mkdocs.yml), a navigation section
will be created for you. However, you will not be able to use alternate titles for
pages, or include links to other sites.

### Site navigation examples

#### `nav` with categories

Below is an example of a `mkdocs.yml` file with a `nav` section. This `nav` section is structure to arrange the files in categories. In this case the categories are `Getting Started` and `Usage`.

```yaml
site_name: My Techdocs
site_description: Documentation for my project
docs_dir: "docs"
nav:
- Getting Started
  - Introduction: index.md
  - Create an account: account.md
  - Setup environment: setup.md
- Usage
  - Deploy locally: local.md 
  - Deploy to OpenShift: openshift.md
plugins:
    - techdocs-core
    - ezlinks
markdown_extensions:
    - markdown_inline_mermaid
    - md_in_html
    -   mkpatcher:
            location: patcher.py
```

#### flat `nav`

Below is another example of a `mkdocs.yml` file. It does not use categories to arrange the documentation pages.

```yaml
site_name: My Techdocs
site_description: Documentation for my project
docs_dir: "docs"
nav:
  - Introduction: index.md
  - Create an account: account.md
  - Setup environment: setup.md
  - Deploy locally: local.md 
  - Deploy to OpenShift: openshift.md
plugins:
    - techdocs-core
    - ezlinks
markdown_extensions:
    - markdown_inline_mermaid
    - md_in_html
    -   mkpatcher:
            location: patcher.py
```

## Notes

Note that MkDocs uses `mkdocs.yml`, not `mkdocs.yaml`, although both appear to work.
Refer to the [mkdocs user guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/) for more details.

## Previewing documentation locally

You will likely want to preview your documentation on your computer. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/bcgov/devhub-techdocs-publish/blob/main/docs/index.md#how-to-use-the-docker-image-to-preview-content-locally) to do so.

## Publishing your documentation

The [.github/workflows/publish.yaml](.github/workflows/publish.yaml) file publishes your documentation to the DevHub website.  It is setup by default to do the following:

* A pull request will publish the code to the `dev.developer.gov.bc.ca` site. This is a development site where you can preview your changes.
* A push to the `main` branch will publish the code to the producton DevHub website. 

You may edit the [.github/workflows/publish.yaml](.github/workflows/publish.yaml) file to use a workflow that works for your project.
