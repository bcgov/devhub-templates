# Guide to creating content and templates 
Use this guide to help you create a strong framework for content creation. Discover valuable resources to lead the development of technical documents in your team's dedicated library in the B.C. government DevHub.

Whether you're enhancing existing content or embarking on new projects, this guide equips you with the essential references and a template to ensure effective communication and compelling documentation.

The content on this page is based on B.C. government resources for web content writing.

## Document template
Use this document template to create a consistent format for both existing and new pages in your team's documentation library.

### Document title
Create a title that captures the essence of the documentation.

* The title will contain the only  **H1** heading though the entire the document. 

* Use sentence case for example: 

    * **Correct way**  
     How to build an application 
    * **Incorrect way**  
How To Build An Application  
How to Build an Application   
how to build an application 

Sentence case means that in headings and page titles you should only capitalize:

* The first word, if it starts with a number such as '2023 Sysdiq monitor', you capitalize the first word after the number

* [Proper nouns](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/capitalization)

* [Abbreviations and acronyms](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/abbreviations) if they have already been defined or are better known to the audience than their long-form equivalent, such as PDF or DNA 

### Version history
It is important for readers to know the last revision of any document.  

You can write the date below the main title:

**Document title**  
Last updated: **Month day, year**


**How to build and application**  
Last updated: **January 1, 2024**

**Choosing 'Last reviewed' vs "Last updated'**<br>
If you have read through he content to make sure it's accurate and up-to-date but have made no changes use 'Last reviewed'.

If you have made any edits, no matter how small, use 'Last updated'. 


### Table of contents
The system will automatically generate a table of contents or also known as "on this page" based on the type of headings you use.  Refer to the B.C. goverment's webstyle guide on the use of [writing headings and page titles](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/headings).

Example for heading's format: 

`# Heading level 1 - H1`
<br>Every page will contain one header level 1 which is given to the title of your page.

`## Heading level 2 - H2`
<br>These are the main headings on your page and can be used several times.

`### Heading level 3 - H3`
<br>These can also be used several times and are sub-headings to H2.

`#### Heading level 4 - H4 `
<br>And these are sub-sub-headings to H3, use in small amounts.

`##### Heading level 5 - H5 and above `
<br> Avoid this level and beyond. 

### How to introduce your topic
Briefly explain the purpose and scope of the documentation. 

An  introduction can be written from a few sentences to a couple of paragraphs, perhaps 3 maximum.  Readers should be able to quickly grasp the purpose of the documentation, the value it provides, and any key information needed to get started.

Write the brief introduction explaining the following questions: 

* What is the document's purpose? 
* Who is the intended reader? 
* What can the readers expect to to find? 
* Why is service or application important? 
* How should readers approach the documentation?
* Are there any prerequisites or dependencies?
* Are there any call to action(s)? 

If readers require more detailed background information, consider providing links to additional resources or dedicated sections within the documentation rather than extending the introduction excessively.

The goal of the introduction is to strike a balance between providing essential information and respecting the reader's time and attention.

### Developing your topic 

As you develop your topic, consider your audience and keep the document's purpose in mind. Here are examples to guide you further:

**About Us**
* Introduce the team or project for a more in-depth understanding

**Installation guides or user guides**
* Provide step-by-step instructions for system setup
* List prerequisites and system requirements
* Determine if visual aids are necessary for better comprehension, keeping in mind to [create accessible content](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/wcag/home/intro/) and review the [accessibility and inclusion toolkit](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/home/accessible-government/toolkit)
* Address common issues and provide troubleshooting solutions

**Core concepts**
* Clearly define the purpose and functionality of the service, project, or application
* Highlight key features and advantages
* Emphasize main functionalities

**Advanced configuration guidelines**
* Explain customization requirements
* Guide on tailoring the service to specific needs
* Provide instructions for integrating with other systems if needed

**Best practices guidelines**
* Contribute to the overall success of a development project
* Promote efficiency, code quality, collaboration, security, and adaptability
* Ensure the knowledge base required aligns with your entire audience; assess if it suits their needs

### Conclusion of your topic
Conclude your topic by ensuring you provide current contact information for readers seeking help or feedback and ensure you summarize the key points on your topic.  

Lastly, include a list of helpful resources, internal or external, as the **last H2 heading** on your page.
