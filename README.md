# DevHub Templates
This repository contains templates that are used by [DevHub](developer.gov.bc.ca), the BC government [developer portal](https://github.com/bcgov/developer-portal). DevHub is based on [Backstage](https://backstage.io), an open source toolkit for build developer portals, which was initiated by Spotify, and is now a CNCF project.

The templates contained in this repository are compatible with the [Backstage "Templates" core feature](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/).
